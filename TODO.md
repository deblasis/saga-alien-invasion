# TODO

I generally use a kanban board to track even my own work, this time I used this simple TODO list that I have updated along the way.

- [x] CLI
- [x] File parser
- [x] Map
- [x] Ensure repeteability in tests even if we are dealing with "random" stuff
- [x] Ensure pseudo-randomness by seeding rand if not in tests
- [x] Alien spawner
- [x] Alien
  - [x] Movement randomizer
- [x] City
- [x] Turns Loop
- [x] Aliens Battle
- [x] Documentation
- [ ] UX improvements
- [x] Bonus: alien names randomizer
- [x] CI/CD and trunk based dev (I am working on this alone... probably overkill for now)

## Thinking ðŸ¤”
- [ ] Consider using an EventBus
